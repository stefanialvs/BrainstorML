Prototype Pipeline
==========================

I divided the main components into two. 
The front-end covered all the interactions for the interface and user’s input and backend, referring to the NLP and ML elements and integration with the interface. 

Based on the Affinity Diagram structure showed in the About page, I modeled the prototype’s pipeline and how the experience would be.
